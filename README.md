# SwiftMD5

SwiftMD5 is pure Swift tool to generate MD5 string.

It is small but powerful. It is just as fast as [CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift) â€˜s MD5 tool. But This tool is smaller than [CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift).

I found that a lot of method to generate MD5 string is Objective-C method. This part of code is fork from [Kingfisher](https://github.com/LimChihi/Kingfisher), and I upgrade it. 

so you can use like this: 


```
let str = "HelloWorld"
let md5 = str.md5

```
